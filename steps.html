v/////////////// Local Setup:

$ mkdir Theme

Create Local Directory has Name Theme

$ cd Theme

Change your terminal to the Theme directory

$ git init

tell your computer that Theme is a directory managed by the Git program

& git add <file_name>

tell the Git program you care about this file and want to track any changes from this point forward

git commit -m "first commit"

So far you've created a file and told Git about it, and now it's time to create a commit. Commit can be thought of as a milestone. Every time you accomplish some work, you can write a Git commit to store that version of your file, so you can go back later and see what it looked like at that point in time. Whenever you make a change to your file, you create a new version of that file, different from the previous one.

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/Pradeepdht/Rudra.git

Now we have connected our local copy of the Demo repository to its remote counterpart on GitHub.com




git branch -M main

$ git push -u origin main

this command push your code to remote directory in main branch





/////// creating new branch

Use of branch:  These new branches can then be used to test changes to code without affecting the main project code.  If the changes work, the branch can be merged back with the main branch.

$ git branch Theme

this creates a new branch named Theme

$ git branch

shows you number of branches in your Repository

$ git checkout Theme

Shifting to your newly created branch Theme

$ git merge Theme

branch added into `master` branch
